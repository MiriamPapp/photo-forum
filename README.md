# Photo-Forum

This project aims to provide an experience like Google+ groups with special support for
photographers' needs.   
It will even be usable as a family photo-album.

> For people interested in hosting the Photo-Forum there is a [dedicated website](https://fte378.github.io/photo-forum/index) which describes all necessary steps.  
> Für alle, die ein Photo-Forum betreiben möchten, gibt es eine [Webseite mit genauen Anleitungen](https://fte378.github.io/photo-forum/index_de).

The software is intended to be used by some photographers who I (the author) know but it may be used
also by anyone else including non-photographers.

The software is designed to be hosted at AWS (Amazon Web Services). It is designed to keep
the costs at a minimum, so anybody should be able to host their own forum without the need
to accept advertising or get restrictions on contents.

The Photo-Forum is designed for closed user groups where you have to get an invitation
to enter. It is not a social network and there is no intention to develop it into one.

At the moment there is no usable functionality because the software is in a very early stage.
