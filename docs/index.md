# Introduction

Photo forum is a set of documentation, configuration files, and software which enables
anyone to run a community with very low financial requirements and without the need
to accept restrictions and regulations of community providers.

Photo forum is designed to run on cloud services of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Only
cheap services are used - all of them serverless. So you pay only for what you use
and often there is a free contingent for many services on AWS.
