# Introduction

[Photo-Forum](https://github.com/fte378/photo-forum)
is a set of documentation, configuration files, and software which enables
anyone to run a community with very low financial requirements and without the need
to accept restrictions and regulations of community providers.

Photo-Forum is designed to run on cloud services of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Only
cheap services are used - all of them serverless. So you pay only for what you use
and often there is a free contingent for many services on AWS.

# Prerequisites

If you want to host Photo-Forum you will need some things in advance. There are descriptions
how to set up all the needed stuff. The users of the forum will need their Internet browser
only - they don't have to set anything up.

See the page _"[Prerequisites](./prerequisites)"_ for more information.

# Installation on AWS
