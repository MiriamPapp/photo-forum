# Create your root account

**A warning first:** This setup description is created to assist people with
average computer knowledge. That's why it doesn't make use of more advanced
(and more secure) features of the AWS security system. Namely MFA, IAM admins
and cross-account access are not used. This is a security flaw but it is by design!   
This also means that you should **NOT** use the here created AWS account for
any other activities on AWS. If you need an additional account create one with
a different e-mail address!  
If you already own an AWS account please create a new one for Photo-forum.   
If you use multiple accounts you can simplify the handling by using different
browsers for the different accounts - for example Firefox for one account and
Chrome for the other.

First go to the [AWS homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). If you never
created an accout at AWS it looks like this:

![Create Amazon account](../img/Amazon-Free-Tier.jpg)

To start creating a new account click on `Create a Free Account`. The process to create
the account is relatively straightforward. Amazon
[describes the process](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)
in its knowledge base.  
It is also possible to start the account creation from the login form (which you get if
you click on `Sign In on the Console`).

Simply follow the instructions in the
[Amazon document](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/). This creates your so called "root account".   
AWS requires you to give them a payment method in advance.
Don't be afraid to do that - you can set limits and alarms for your
costs and the software has a low footprint regarding costs.   
Usually you have to pay nothing within the first year and after that the costs
are very low.

If you created your root account you can login and logout to/from AWS within the AWS console.   
Please ensure that you keep your login credentials safe and accessible!

# Enable aws-cli access

In the AWS management console (the thing you see after logging in) select "Services" at the upper left
corner and choose the IAM service. You can use the search field at the top of the services overview.

You will see a page similar to this one:

![IAM dashboard](../img/IAM.jpg)

To be able to work with the necessary tools you need credentials for programs. AWS provides
access keys for this purpose.  
You save the keys on your computer and have then very easily access to your AWS account.  

Please open a terminal window again (or the Windows shell on Windows). Enter the following
command (and do not enter anythin afterwards):
```Shell
aws configure --profile awsadmin
```
The program now asks for your accesskey id. We have to generate it first in the AWS console.

In the AWS console look for your account name in the upper right corner (adjacent to the
bell symbol) - in my images this is `PhotoForum Root`.

Click on the name and select `My Security Credentials`.   

At the page now displayed select `Access keys (access key ID and secret access key)`.

![access keys](../img/accesskeys.jpg)

Now click on the blue button named `Create New Access Key`. The access key and secret key are
automatically created and the following window is displayed in the browser:

![access keys](../img/keycreated.jpg)

Please click on `Download Key File` and open the downloaded file with your favorite text
editor (possibly Excel is opened on Windows because the file is named rootkey.csv).  
The file contents look similar to this (of course the Id and Key are different from the following):

![access keys](../img/keys.jpg)

**Important**: These keys are the entry to your AWS account! So you don't have to show them
anybody else and you must store them securely.
The aws program stores the information inside your user directory in a subdirectory called
`.aws`. The two created files are called `config`and `credentials`.    
You have still
your window open (terminal/Windows shell) where the aws command asks for you access key Id.   
Please copy the Id (it's in the first line of your CSV file) and paste it into the aws
program. Then press enter in this window.   
aws now asks for the secret access key with `Enter Secret Access Key:`.   
Again copy the secret key from your CSV file to your aws program and press enter.

The program now asks for your default region where you want to access the AWS services.
This highly depends on your needs - if you are in Europe either `eu-central-1` (Germany) or
`eu-west-1` (Ireland) may be good choices. The most important factor for choosing a region
should be the location of your forum members - the speed of their data access may depend on this.   
Other factors of choosing a region may be privacy regulations, the law or even the price.

The regions have different prices - see
[this page](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/?nc1=h_ls) for more information and look
for the `S3 Standard Storage`, `Request pricing S3 Standard` and `Data Transfer pricing`
information.    
I couldn't find a simple region list for the `Amazon S3` service but
to look up the region identifiers have
a look at the [endpoint list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html)
and compare the region names with the ones from the prices page.

Now enter your region identifier into the aws program and press Enter.

**Congratulations!** Now you are able to use programs to do things in AWS.

To check the configured aws program issue the following command:
```Shell
aws iam get-user --profile awsadmin
```

This should print some cryptic information which may look like this:
```
{
    "User": {
        "UserId": "063516392340",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::063516392340:root",
        "CreateDate": "2019-02-03T17:48:37Z",
        "PasswordLastUsed": "2019-02-12T17:15:21Z"
    }
}
```

Now you have finished your prerequisites setup. You may continue with the software installation
on AWS described on the [Start page](../index).
