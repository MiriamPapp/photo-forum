# Local hosting of the github pages

If you want to serve the github pages on your computer (for example to change and test them),
you need an [installed Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) interpreter.  
Then enter the following commands in your terminal window:  
```Shell
gem install bundler jekyll
cd docs  <- the directory in this project
gem install
bundle exec jekyll serve 
```
