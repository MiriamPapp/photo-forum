# Preconditions

In order to install Python on yourt system you need to do the Steps
in _"[Set up your installation environment](../envsetup)"_ first.   
See the _"[Start page](../index)"_ for an overview.

# Download the correct Python installer

The starting popint for installing Python is the
[Download page on www.python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

There you can select the version for your operating system. Unless you have a *very old*
computer the correct versions will be the ones marked as _64bit_.

For Windows this would be the *Windows x86-64 executable installer*.   For Mac-OS it should
be the *macOS 64-bit installer*.   
The Windows installer does have "amd64" in it's name. Dont worry - this is the correct
installer even if you have a computer with an Intel CPU.

The Windows installer is a normal *.exe*-file which can be run from the download folder
or even directly from the download dialogue within your internet browser.   
The Mac-OS installer is in the package format which can be run by a double click.

# Installation on MS Windows

There is a whole
[section on installing Python](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html) in the
*Python Setup and Usage* guide on docs.python.org.

It describes several ways to install Python so you would still have to decide
some things that you possibly can't decide because of missing information or experience.

To make all installation steps easier I will give you the exact steps for installation.
It will make available all needed software for your current system user and it will keep
all needed pieces together as much as possible.   
The whole installation will be done in your _home directory_.

1. Open the Windows-Explorer (your systems file manager) and go to the downloads folder.  
   Locate the downloaded Python installer (for example `python-3.7.2-amd64.exe`) and double-click it.
