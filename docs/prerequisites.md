**Please** follow the installation steps **to the point** - don't omit things, don't do them differently.
This will only create frustration and support overhead.   
In case you want to get rid of the prerequisites you can follow the
[uninstall](../uninstall) instructions.

1. **Computer**  
  This is a real requirement. You need a computer. A tablet or smartphone will not be enough.
  Any computer will do - running MS-Windows, Mac-OS, Linux or any other Unix like system.
2. **Installation environment**  
  To make all installation steps easier I will give you the exact steps for installation.  
  It will make available all needed software for your current system user and it will keep
  all needed pieces together as much as possible.   
  The whole installation will be done in your _home directory_.   
  Please follow the steps described in _"[Set up your installation environment](../envsetup)"_ first.
3. **Python**  
  Several used tools require an installed Python interpreter.
  [Python is a programming language](https://www.python.org/)
  which is available for nearly every computer system. Please use the most current Python version
  for installation. Even if your system already contains a Python version provided by your operating
  system (for example Mac-OS) you should install a private copy of Python to not interfere with
  system tools.  
  To set up Python on your computer follow the instructions in
  _"[How to install Python on your computer](../pythonsetup)"_.
4. **node.js and npm**   
   [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime which also contains the
   packet manager `npm` for Javascript packages. It will be used for management tasks.  
   To set up node.js on your computer follow the instructions in
   _"[How to install node.js on your computer](../nodesetup)"_.
5. **git**  
  [git](https://git-scm.com) is a modern decentralized source code management system. You will use
  it to get all needed files for your installation and to keep them up to date.   
  To set up git on your computer follow the instructions in
  _"[How to install git on your computer](../gitsetup)"_.
6. **AWS tools**  
  AWS is handled through the aws command line. To set up the needed tools follow the instructions in
  _"[How to install the aws tools on your computer](../awstoolssetup)"_.
7. **AWS-account**  
  Because you will run the service on AWS you need an account there.   
  To set up an account follow the instructions in
  _"[How to set up your AWS account](../awssetup)"_.

If you finished all steps you are prepared to really install your forum software on AWS.
